# MSDS682 Data Stream Processing (2025)
This is a class example data and code repository for USF MSDSE682 in Fall 2025.

## About this Repo
Detailed course schedules and slides are available in the course Canvas page.

Each folder indicates the day of the lecture (Ex. Day1, Day2, etc.) and includes corresponding example codes. Please note that I encourage you to work on Skeleton codes first, rather than just taking a look at example answer codes.

Data are stored under the Data directory.

This repo will be regularlly updated, and I encourage you to pull at the beginning of every class.
